# Practice Project: Using `randrange()` and `randint()` with Lists

### Instructions 
- For each problem, test your code to verify that it runs correctly and produces random outputs
- Be prepared to discuss your work with your teacher during Teacher Time
- Upload your script to a new GitHub repo named **randomness-practice**

### Problems Using `randrange()`

1. **Random Color Selector**
   - Create a list of five colors (e.g., "red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple").
   - Use the `len()` function to determine the number of colors in the list.
   - Use the `randrange()` method to select a random index and print the corresponding color from the list.



2. **Random Animal Index**
   - Define a list of animal names (e.g., "dog", "cat", "elephant", "giraffe", "lion").
   - Use the `len()` function to find the number of animals in the list.
   - Use `randrange()` to select a random index and output the animal at that index. Repeat this process three times to display three randomly selected animals.



3. **Random Number from a List**
   - Create a list of ten numbers (e.g., from 1 to 10).
   - Use the `len()` function to find the number of elements in the list.
   - Use `randrange()` to randomly select an index and print the number at that index. Make your output clear by stating which number was selected and from which index.

 

### Problems Using `randint()`

4. **Random Fruit Selector**
   - Create a list of fruits (e.g., "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig").
   - Use the `len()` function to determine the number of fruits in the list.
   - Use the `randint()` method to select a random index and print the fruit at that index.



5. **Random Score Generator**
   - Define a list of five students' names.
   - Use the `len()` function to find the number of students in the list.
   - Use `randint()` to generate a random score between 0 and 100 for each student. Print each student's name along with their randomly generated score.


6. **Random Movie Selector**
   - Create a list of five movies (e.g., "Inception", "Titanic", "Avatar", "The Dark Knight", "Interstellar").
   - Use the `len()` function to find the number of movies in the list.
   - Use `randint()` to select a random movie and print the randomly selected movie along with its index in the list.
